# Comparative Tables of Mythological Elements

This section presents tables designed to align and compare key elements from the diverse myths discussed in this research. The goal is to highlight shared motifs—celestial signs, journey types, catastrophic contexts, and "similar sounding events"—that may point towards a common origin or a shared response to significant historical phenomena.
