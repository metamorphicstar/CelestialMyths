# CelestialMyths: A Unified Past - Celestial Events and Global Mythology

This repository hosts the research and content for the CelestialMyths website, an exploration of the hypothesis that many of our world's ancient myths, though culturally distinct, may share a common origin rooted in powerful, globally witnessed celestial events.

We delve into narratives from diverse cultures â€“ from the Arthurian Grail and the Hungarian Celestial Stag to Constantine's vision of the cross and beyond. These stories often feature radiant celestial signs guiding transformative journeys, frequently set against a backdrop of widespread catastrophe.

## Core Research Focus:

*   **A Single Celestial Event?** Investigating if a singular, globally significant celestial event (comet, solar flares, plasma phenomena) left a common mark on human consciousness, encoded in myth.
*   **Revisiting Chronology:** Considering the work of researchers like Gunnar Heinsohn, who propose that conventional historical timelines for the first millennium AD may be flawed. A revised chronology could align seemingly disparate events and myths.
*   **"Similar Sounding Events" as Signposts:** Using thematic parallels in myths (luminous guides, epic journeys, wastelands) as primary signposts for connection, rather than relying solely on potentially unreliable conventional dating.
*   **From Complex Myths to Simpler Reality:** Proposing that these varied myths might resolve into a simpler underlying reality: a shared human experience of an extraordinary sky event, akin to how heliocentrism simplified explanations of celestial mechanics.
