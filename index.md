# Unveiling a Unified Past: Celestial Events and Global Mythology

Welcome to an exploration of a fascinating hypothesis: that many of our world's ancient myths, though culturally distinct, may share a common origin rooted in powerful celestial events. This research delves into narratives from diverse cultures – from the Arthurian Grail and the Hungarian Celestial Stag to Constantine's vision of the cross and beyond – all featuring radiant celestial signs guiding transformative journeys, often against a backdrop of widespread catastrophe.

## Core Ideas:

*   **A Single Celestial Event?** We investigate the possibility that a singular, globally significant celestial event (such as a major comet, a series of solar flares, or intense plasma phenomena) left an indelible mark on human consciousness, encoded in myth.
*   **Revisiting Chronology:** The work of researchers like Gunnar Heinsohn suggests that conventional historical timelines for the first millennium AD may be significantly flawed. By considering a revised chronology that collapses several centuries (roughly AD 230-930) into a more condensed period ending in a 10th-century cataclysm, events and myths traditionally seen as disparate might, in fact, be contemporaneous.
*   **"Similar Sounding Events" as Signposts:** Rather than relying solely on what may be unreliable modern dating, this research uses thematic parallels in myths—shared motifs of luminous celestial guides, epic migrations or quests, and depictions of wastelands or darkened skies—as "similar sounding events" that act as temporal and causal signposts.
*   **From Complex Myths to Simpler Reality:** Just as the heliocentric model eventually provided a simpler and more accurate explanation for celestial mechanics than complex epicycles, we propose that these varied and intricate myths might resolve into a simpler underlying reality: a shared human experience of an extraordinary sky event.

This website aims to document the growing catalog of these interconnected myths, present comparative analyses, and explore the potential astronomical and historical frameworks that might explain their profound similarities.
