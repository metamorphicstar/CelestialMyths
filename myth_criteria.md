# Myth Account Inclusion Criteria

This document outlines the key criteria a mythological account should meet to be considered for inclusion in the comparative study. The primary focus is on narratives that link celestial events to significant human actions, particularly migrations or major quests, within a specific historical timeframe.

## Core Criteria:

1.  **Initiating Celestial Sign:**
    *   The narrative must prominently feature a distinct and observable celestial sign or phenomenon.
    *   Examples include: a unique star, a comet, a meteor shower, an unusual aurora, a specific planetary conjunction, an unexplained light in the sky, or other significant atmospheric optical events.
    *   This sign should be a clear antecedent event in the story.

2.  **Prompted Relocation or Quest:**
    *   The appearance of this celestial sign must serve as the direct trigger, motivation, or divine guidance for a group of people (e.g., a tribe, nation, significant cultural group) to undertake:
        *   A substantial migration to a new territory.
        *   A major, often arduous, quest of cultural or spiritual significance.
        *   The founding of a new settlement or civilization in a new location.
    *   The journey or quest should be a central element of the narrative stemming from the celestial observation.

3.  **Chronological Window:**
    *   The core events of the myth, or the period it purports to describe, should ideally be datable or reasonably placeable, even if approximately, between **200 AD and 1000 AD**.
    *   This timeframe acknowledges potential inaccuracies in dating due to oral traditions, later textual recordings, or varying cultural chronologies. The aim is to capture events that could plausibly be linked to phenomena within this broad period.

## Secondary Considerations (Desirable but not strictly mandatory if core criteria are met):

*   **Catastrophic Context:** Often, these myths occur against a backdrop of environmental crisis (e.g., famine, drought, flood, "darkened skies") or societal upheaval, which may be linked to or exacerbated by the celestial event.
*   **"Similar Sounding Links":** Shared motifs or narrative patterns with other myths in the catalog, even if direct historical contact is not implied. This includes themes of divine messengers, sacred objects, trials, and transformations.
*   **Visual Archetype Similarity:** An added positive factor if the celestial sign's description suggests a visual form that could be culturally interpreted as:
    *   **Grail-like:** e.g., a radiant, cup-shaped, bowl-like, or vessel-like object, potentially appearing to float or hover.
    *   **Stag-like:** e.g., a radiant body with prominent horn-like, antler-like, or branching protrusions.
    This recognizes that different cultures might describe a similar unfamiliar celestial phenomenon using familiar symbolic shapes, leading to varied but potentially related visual archetypes.

Adherence to the three core criteria is paramount for a myth's inclusion and detailed comparative analysis.
