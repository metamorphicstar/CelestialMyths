# Catalog of Investigated Myths

This page serves as a growing catalog of the diverse global myths being investigated for their potential connections to a unified celestial event. Each myth typically features a prominent celestial sign, a significant journey or quest, and often a backdrop of environmental or societal crisis. The "similar sounding" motifs across these stories are central to this research.

*(This catalog will be expanded. Brief summaries are provided below, with more detailed analyses found in the comparative tables and future dedicated sections.)*
